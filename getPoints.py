A new scoring system was introduced in your university: from now on, each test will consist of the predefined list of questions, and for the ith (1-based) question a student either gets i points, or loses p points as a penalty.
Your task is to calculate the number of points a student got for some test. Implement a function that would calculate the number of points received for the test based on the given list of answers.
